- build without "commons-httpclient" (3.x) - port everything to httpcore/httpclient (4.x)

done, but it's still in classpath, otherwise unopkg add fails:

----
ERROR: An error occurred while enabling: LPSP.jar
       Cause: (com.sun.star.registry.CannotRegisterImplementationException) { { Message = "", Context = (com.sun.star.uno.XInterface) @0 } }

unopkg failed.
----

- port testcases from the proto
- get rid of fr.starxpert namespace
- l10n of the interface
- save fails when server url is given without explicit port ':80'?
- "up" in the filepicker is broken
