= Diploma 2 log

== 1st week

=== 2011-09-06

In ULX, meeting with Gabor, Ivan and Akos, discussing what "workflow
integration in an office environment" means.

No consensus, next meeting scheduled later this week.

=== 2011-09-07

Replied to redmine ticket: the LPSP extension fails to open a GUI window on
OSX. I already found a possible fix, searched the exact commit and bug id.

Set up a sharepoint virtual machine on localhost. (I can't get wireshark to
monitor the traffic in both directions when sharepoint runs on a remote virtual
machine.)

=== 2011-09-08

Meeting with Akos: we clarified most of the points in the initial "for this
semester" spec, I need to write up a more detailed one.

Meeting with Ivan and Gabor: more discussion, especially about what does a
long-term workflow stand for, decision points and undoing a task assignment.

Wrote up a more detailed spec in SVN.

=== 2011-09-09

In ULX. Ivan pointed out a drools (including jbmp5) demo they set up earlier:

http://droolsdemo-process:8080/gwt-console/
http://droolsdemo-process:8080/gwt-console-server/

Based on that, I'm trying to set up my own jbmp instance. Downloaded
jbpm-5.1.0.Final-installer-full.zip from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/jBPM%205/jbpm-5.1.0.Final/.

Following the install.html from that ZIP, I get a web console at
http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console, and the REST API at
http://localhost:8080/gwt-console-server/.

Found more documentation at: http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.1/userguide/

This was also helpful: http://jkrzemie.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/jbpm-5-0-creating-simple-human-tasks-with-variables/

Questions:
- where are human task templates stored? -> looks like in separate .ftl files, have to be deployed using guvnor.
- user management? -> should be plain ini-like text files under auth/, but that did not really work here for some reason.
- rest interface auth problems -> the example provided in the documentation is obsolete, using apache httpclient should be a solution, example here: http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/riftsaw/trunk/samples/quickstart/management/src/org/jboss/riftsaw/management/ManagementClient.java

- I have a working example on how to authenticate and get list of personal tasks as JSON.
- Also read about gson: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ which is used by
  jboss to serialize / unserialize java objects to/from json. I now have a
  working example on how to build a List<Task> object from a JSON result (as
  far as I see, it's necessary to write TaskRef.java and TaskRefWrapper.java
  manually to do so).

Then I looked at related work. Keywords: 'document based workflow',
'document-driven workflow', 'document-centric workflows'.

- http://php.scripts.psu.edu/faculty/a/x/axk41/BPM05-jerry-reprint.pdf
  A framework for document-driven workflow systems (J Wang)
  -> details why information and resource based workflows are also important, not just control based ones
  -> idea: user changes the document, change listeners intercepts changes, check constraints, then accept or reject
           various complex features planned: split/merge of documents, different locking types
  -> implementation using sql triggers (ugh)
  -> detailed comparison of control flow based vs. document based approach (pro/con)
- https://mailserver.di.unipi.it/ricerca/proceedings/ICSE2008/sam/p21.pdf
  Mobility in the virtual office: a document-centric workflow approach (R Carbon, G Johann, T Keuler, D Muthig)

  XDoC-WFMS: A Framework for Document Centric Workflow Management System (R Krishnan, L Munaga)
  -> great examples where document-centric approach is intuitive: newspaper editing, processing job applications
  -> idea: documents have an embedded micro-agent, so the document itself will know where to submit, etc.

  -> an approach without decoupling: here the workflow object communicates with the document object

=== 2011-09-11

Worked on the 'recently used documents' feature in the extension, requested by Ivan.

Version to test: lpsp-0.1-387-g273a329.oxt

Implemented functions:
- modified the extension configuration schema, so it can store a list of recently used URL's for each configured server.
- when opening a document, that list is loaded from $HOME/.openoffice.org/3/user/registrymodifications.xcu, the opened document is inserted to the start of the list, then saved.
- there is a new button in the file picker, making it possible to view this list
- the 'up' button can be used to return to the root directory from the recently used documents

== 2nd week

=== 2011-09-12

Worked on the favorites feature in the extension.

Version to test: lpsp-0.1-396-g4ecd817.oxt

Implemented functions:
- new button to add a folder or file to favorites
- add/delete is first confirmed using a popup dialog
- new button to list favorites
- as with recently used documents, the 'up' button can be used to return to the root directory

=== 2011-09-13

Created my first BPMN with two human tasks (and committed to SVN). That sounds
easy, but there were two pitfalls:

- starting the h2 database and then starting jboss is not enough, there is a need to start a separate 'human task server' as well

So the proper way to restart jbpm after changing the BPMN and/or templates is:

----
ant stop.jboss && ant stop.h2 && ant start.h2 && ant start.jboss && ant start.human.task
----

- creating a new BPMN does not work with 'File -> New -> File', and just using
  the `.bpmn` extension, as that results in an XML reader exception, what works
  is: 'File -> New -> Other', then 'Drools -> Flow file'

=== 2011-09-14

In ULX. Worked on completing a task via REST API, created an example
successfully. First I thought it will be easy as the login form already used
UrlEncodedFormEntity successfully, but on task completion a MultipartEntity
should be used to send the (empty) form.

Ported the sample codes to http-core 4.x (that is needed, as 3.x has a
different api, not supporting NTLM auth). Created a WFHandler (similar to the
Handler of the sharepoint jar):

- it can check username/password - login
- can list assigned tasks
- can complete a task
- can get the document url of a task
- can list documents: it simulates a root directory with documents, extracted from assigned tasks.

Figured out how to add new users to jbpm and/or change password: there is an
auth/users.properties file, but that's used by the installer only. The real
configuration file is under jboss-*/server/default/conf/users.properties. Once
updated and jbpm is restarted, logging in with the new user works fine.

Then - for some unknown reason - the eclipse of jbpm stopped recognizing bpmn
files as a graphically editable object, finally I had to re-deploy the eclipse
configuration.

Finally a problem: assigning a task to the user `krisv` works, but when I try to assign a task to the user `admin`, I get:

I'll try to see what are the differences between the two accounts.

=== 2011-09-15

So the problem is that the underlying h2 database does not contain an entry for
the `admin` user. Asked on IRC (#jbpm, irc.codehaus.org), the conclusion was
that this is a bug, created JIRA ticket:
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPM-3356

In the meantime, I created a user `john` on the Alfresco server so I can
progress further.

I added code to be able to specify a workflow server url in the extension, with
that it's now possible to get a list of documents from the assigned task list.

The next step can be an extra checkbox on the save dialog to complete such a
task.

=== 2011-09-16

In ULX. Trying to add a checkbox to the save dialog that is unchecked and
disabled when not connected to a workflow server. I got a strange exception
during getting the workflow handler, so I looked up documentation on how can I
debug an extension from eclipse.

The extension part is described here:
http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Java_and_OpenOffice.org#How_do_I_debug_Java_components_in_OpenOffice.org.3F

The Eclipse part is here: http://cedric.bosdonnat.free.fr/wordpress/?p=57

With that, I now have a workflow view in the file picker (when a workflow
server is configured), and I can also select if I want to complete the workflow
task when I save. -- It's unchecked and disabled when there is no workflow.

We discussed with Ivan, and decided that a process instance will "lock" a
document, so multiple processes can't own the same document.

The next step is to deal with decisions. Created a `Decision.bpmn` that
contains a human task, then a gateway that branches based on that human task.
That first task in the BPMN contains a form with two buttons and that sets the
`decision` string to `accept` or `reject`.

Once I had such a BPMN, I could see how to make a decision via the GWT console,
then I added support for this in the extension as well.

Did the tests requested by Gabor: on Linux x86_64 (Frugalware 1.5) and Windows XP 32bit (in kvm).

- OOo 3.3 on Linux is fine (that's what I develop for nowadays, as later relases are at the moment backwards-compatible)
- LO 3.4 on Linux: based on quick testing -- fine
- OOo 3.3 on Windows: does not work, I hit the issue described here: http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Extensions_trouble_shooting
- LO 3.4 on Windows: based on quick testing -- fine

In all cases I used the official upstream binaries, either from Oracle or from TDF.

There was an issue with LO on Windows: adding a new server was not possible
till I increased the height of the window, but that's now fixed in SVN.

Did a change requested by Ivan: now files from the document server are
accessible, even if there is a workflow server connected. This is solved by a
new 'workflow' button which can list assigned documents. When there is a
workflow server, this view is the default -- when there is no workflow, then
the workflow button is disabled. I also added tooltips to the buttons, since
now there are 6 of them and just the 16x16px buttons are not that intuitive.

Version to test: lpsp-0.1-443-gc44534e.oxt

Looked at more related work. This time I did not search papers, but products.
First I had a look what Sharepoint supports. Introduction article:

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-designer-help/create-a-workflow-HA010100591.aspx

First, I wasted time with installing Visual Studio Express on the client
machine (as it was mentioned as a dependency of 'Windows Workflow Foundation'),
already having Office, but later turned out that what I need is 'SharePoint
Designer 2007'. It's freely available here:

http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=21581

Here is a simple example, sending notifications to users when an item assigned to them is created or changed:
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-designer-help/workflow-example-send-a-notification-message-HA010182908.aspx

There is still a lot of features to explore, so I don't declare 'checking
sharepoint' as done yet.

TODO:

- look for more related work on 'document based workflows'
- look up Alfresco source code to see if minor/major versions are still ignored
  in Sharepoint mode
