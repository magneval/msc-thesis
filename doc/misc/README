== 1st week

In ULX, meeting with Gabor, Ivan and Akos, discussing what "workflow
integration in an office environment" means.

No consensus, next meeting scheduled later this week.

Replied to redmine ticket: the LPSP extension fails to open a GUI window on
OSX. I already found a possible fix, searched the exact commit and bug id.

In progress: set up a sharepoint virtual machine on localhost. (I can't get
wireshark to monitor the traffic in both directions when sharepoint runs on a
remote virtual machine.)

Next plan: see if the checkin/checkout problems in the redmine ticket are
reproducible in Sharepoint (I guess not).
