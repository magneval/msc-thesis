= Diploma 2 log

== 1st week

=== 2011-09-06

In ULX, meeting with Gabor, Ivan and Akos, discussing what "workflow
integration in an office environment" means.

No consensus, next meeting scheduled later this week.

=== 2011-09-07

Replied to redmine ticket: the LPSP extension fails to open a GUI window on
OSX. I already found a possible fix, searched the exact commit and bug id.

Set up a sharepoint virtual machine on localhost. (I can't get wireshark to
monitor the traffic in both directions when sharepoint runs on a remote virtual
machine.)

Meeting with Akos: we clarified most of the points in the initial "for this
semester" spec, I need to write up a more detailed one.

Meeting with Ivan and Gabor: more discussion, especially about what does a
long-term workflow stand for, decision points and undoing a task assignment.

Wrote up a more detailed spec in SVN.

In ULX. Ivan pointed out a drools (including jbmp5) demo they set up earlier:

http://droolsdemo-process:8080/gwt-console/
http://droolsdemo-process:8080/gwt-console-server/

Based on that, I'm trying to set up my own jbmp instance. Downloaded
jbpm-5.1.0.Final-installer-full.zip from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/jBPM%205/jbpm-5.1.0.Final/.

Following the install.html from that ZIP, I get a web console at
http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console, and the REST API at
http://localhost:8080/gwt-console-server/.

Found more documentation at: http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.1/userguide/

This was also helpful: http://jkrzemie.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/jbpm-5-0-creating-simple-human-tasks-with-variables/

Questions:
- where are human task templates stored? -> looks like in separate .ftl files, have to be deployed using guvnor.
- user management? -> should be plain ini-like text files under auth/, but that did not really work here for some reason.
- rest interface auth problems -> the example provided in the documentation is obsolete, using apache httpclient should be a solution, example here: http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/riftsaw/trunk/samples/quickstart/management/src/org/jboss/riftsaw/management/ManagementClient.java

- I have a working example on how to authenticate and get list of personal tasks as JSON.
- Also read about gson: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ which is used by
  jboss to serialize / unserialize java objects to/from json. I now have a
  working example on how to build a List<Task> object from a JSON result (as
  far as I see, it's necessary to write TaskRef.java and TaskRefWrapper.java
  manually to do so).

Then I looked at related work. Keywords: 'document based workflow',
'document-driven workflow', 'document-centric workflows'.

  A framework for document-driven workflow systems (J Wang)
  -> details why information and resource based workflows are also important, not just control based ones
  -> idea: user changes the document, change listeners intercepts changes, check constraints, then accept or reject
           various complex features planned: split/merge of documents, different locking types
  -> implementation using sql triggers (ugh)
  -> detailed comparison of control flow based vs. document based approach (pro/con)

  Mobility in the virtual office: a document-centric workflow approach (R Carbon, G Johann, T Keuler, D Muthig)
  -> introduces decentralized document-driven workflows, where changes to workflows travel with the documents
     decentralization is handled with a peer-to-peer architecture

  XDoC-WFMS: A Framework for Document Centric Workflow Management System (R Krishnan, L Munaga)
  -> great examples where document-centric approach is intuitive: newspaper editing, processing job applications
  -> idea: documents have an embedded micro-agent, so the document itself will know where to submit, etc.

  -> an approach without decoupling: here the workflow object communicates with the document object

Worked on the 'recently used documents' feature in the extension, requested by Ivan.

Version to test: lpsp-0.1-387-g273a329.oxt

Implemented functions:
- modified the extension configuration schema, so it can store a list of recently used URL's for each configured server.
- when opening a document, that list is loaded from $HOME/.openoffice.org/3/user/registrymodifications.xcu, the opened document is inserted to the start of the list, then saved.
- there is a new button in the file picker, making it possible to view this list
- the 'up' button can be used to return to the root directory from the recently used documents

TODO:

- create working example for completing a human task via REST: moving a workflow to a next step, making a binary decision
- look for more related work on 'document based workflows'
- extension: favorites (files, folders)
- look up Alfresco source code to see if minor/major versions are still ignored
  in Sharepoint mode
