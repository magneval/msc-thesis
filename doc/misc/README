== 1st week

=== 2011-09-06

In ULX, meeting with Gabor, Ivan and Akos, discussing what "workflow
integration in an office environment" means.

No consensus, next meeting scheduled later this week.

Replied to redmine ticket: the LPSP extension fails to open a GUI window on
OSX. I already found a possible fix, searched the exact commit and bug id.

Set up a sharepoint virtual machine on localhost. (I can't get wireshark to
monitor the traffic in both directions when sharepoint runs on a remote virtual
machine.)

Meeting with Akos: we clarified most of the points in the initial "for this
semester" spec, I need to write up a more detailed one.

Meeting with Ivan and Gabor: more discussion, especially about what does a
long-term workflow stand for, decision points and undoing a task assignment.

Wrote up a more detailed spec in SVN.

TODO:

- extension: recently used documents (files), favorites (files, folders)
- look up Alfresco source code to see if minor/major versions are still ignored
  in Sharepoint mode
