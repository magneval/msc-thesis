= Diploma 2 log

== 1st week

=== 2011-09-06

In ULX, meeting with Gabor, Ivan and Akos, discussing what "workflow
integration in an office environment" means.

No consensus, next meeting scheduled later this week.

=== 2011-09-07

Replied to redmine ticket: the LPSP extension fails to open a GUI window on
OSX. I already found a possible fix, searched the exact commit and bug id.

Set up a sharepoint virtual machine on localhost. (I can't get wireshark to
monitor the traffic in both directions when sharepoint runs on a remote virtual
machine.)

Meeting with Akos: we clarified most of the points in the initial "for this
semester" spec, I need to write up a more detailed one.

Meeting with Ivan and Gabor: more discussion, especially about what does a
long-term workflow stand for, decision points and undoing a task assignment.

Wrote up a more detailed spec in SVN.

In ULX. Ivan pointed out a drools (including jbmp5) demo they set up earlier:

http://droolsdemo-process:8080/gwt-console/
http://droolsdemo-process:8080/gwt-console-server/

Based on that, I'm trying to set up my own jbmp instance. Downloaded
jbpm-5.1.0.Final-installer-full.zip from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/jBPM%205/jbpm-5.1.0.Final/.

Following the install.html from that ZIP, I get a web console at
http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console, and the REST API at
http://localhost:8080/gwt-console-server/.

Found more documentation at: http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v5.1/userguide/

This was also helpful: http://jkrzemie.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/jbpm-5-0-creating-simple-human-tasks-with-variables/

Questions:
- where are human task templates stored? -> looks like in separate .ftl files, have to be deployed using guvnor.
- user management? -> should be plain ini-like text files under auth/, but does I
- rest interface auth problems -> the example provided in the documentation is obsolete, using apache httpclient should be a solution, example here: http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/riftsaw/trunk/samples/quickstart/management/src/org/jboss/riftsaw/management/ManagementClient.java

TODO:

- extension: recently used documents (files), favorites (files, folders)
- look up Alfresco source code to see if minor/major versions are still ignored
  in Sharepoint mode
