\subsection{UNO compontents}

My solution will be a LibreOffice extension that registers an UNO\cite{uno}
component. UNO is the interface based component model of LibreOffice. The main
feature it provides is that interfaces are defined in a language-idependent
IDL-like language, and they can be implemented in multiple languages:

\begin{itemize}
\item C
\item C++
\item Python
\item Java
\item BASIC
\end{itemize}

The caller is not aware which language the implementation uses, and it does not
need to, either. In my extension, I call BASIC macros from the menu elements,
which invoke the underlying Java code, where the business logic is implemented.

All the Java code is contained by a single jar file, the workflow of creating
it is the following:
