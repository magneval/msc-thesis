\section{Related Work}

We already saw that there is no solution today (except my extension) that is
open-source, requires no additional server-side installation and communicates
with a Microsoft SharePoint server. However there are similar projects, which
-- even if they solve a sightly different problem -- may provide excellent
ideas to borrow.

\subsection*{OPAL}
We already introduced OPAL, which is open-source, but:

\begin{itemize}
\item Requires server-side modifications.
\item Works with an Alfresco server.
\item Not really maintained (does not work with latest stable OpenOffice.org).
\end{itemize}

However, its user interface and concepts are quite similar to my solution.

\subsection*{LibreOffice CMIS}
LibreOffice CMIS\cite{locmis} is a LibreOffice extension: a Java based
implementation of a Universal Content Provider for making any content in a CMIS
repository usable from LibreOffice. The main problem with it is that SharePoint
2007 does not implement CMIS, so this does not solve our problem at the moment.

\subsection*{SharePoint Connector}
The Oracle Connector for SharePoint Server\cite{oracle-sp-connector} is a
commercial OpenOffice.org extension, providing SharePoint support in
OpenOffice.org. It has multiple problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is not free. Sadly it is part of Oracle Open Office Enterprise
Edition, which is no longer available from the Oracle Store at the time of
writing (May 2011).
\item When we earlier checked it, It was only available on Windows 32-bit and it
required a server-side component as well.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Drupal SharePoint module}

An additional SharePoint module\cite{drupal-sp} for the Drupal content management system is also available. It solves a different problem, though:

\begin{itemize}
\item It can only read from a SharePoint server.
\item It is written for a CMS, not an office suite.
\item To reach its goals, it was enough to use the SOAP interface of the
SharePoint server, which is not enough for my purposes.
\end{itemize}
